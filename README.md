# VTKLoader
Loader made to convert VTK data into points data

for the volume data

First iteration working, dimension 0-2 represent the points location, dimension 3 represents the velocity magnitude of the vector at point xyz and dimension 4-6 represent the vector at point xyz. 7 means the timepoint.

pathline data
The pathline data at the moment consists of an x y and z value where every 8 points constitute to 1 line.

for more information or changes to make the loader work for your vtk data ask me and ill make the necesary changes so it is able to deal with the data
